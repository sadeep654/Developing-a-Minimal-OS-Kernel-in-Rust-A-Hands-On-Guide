## 🔹 Overview

Every so often, a technical rabbit hole changes how you see computers entirely. Writing a tiny operating system in Rust is one of those unusual journeys: part engineering, part archaeology, part stubborn curiosity. And nothing beats the moment a blank QEMU window finally responds with a humble “Hello World.”

## 🔹 Why Rust Shows Up in OS Conversations So Often

>Rust didn’t become a systems-programming favourite by accident. It eliminates memory mistakes without leaning on garbage collection, and its compiler feels more like a co-pilot than a judge.

>Once the toolchain is installed — a quick step through the official Rust site — you’re ready to approach bare-metal programming with confidence.
