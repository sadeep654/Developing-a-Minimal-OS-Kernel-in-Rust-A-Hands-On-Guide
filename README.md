## 🔹 Overview

Every so often, a technical rabbit hole changes how you see computers entirely. Writing a tiny operating system in Rust is one of those unusual journeys: part engineering, part archaeology, part stubborn curiosity. And nothing beats the moment a blank QEMU window finally responds with a humble “Hello World.”

## 🔹 Why Rust Shows Up in OS Conversations So Often

>Rust didn’t become a systems-programming favourite by accident. It eliminates memory mistakes without leaning on garbage collection, and its compiler feels more like a co-pilot than a judge.

>Once the toolchain is installed — a quick step through the official Rust site — you’re ready to approach bare-metal programming with confidence.

>### 🔹 Rust Installation
Rust is installed via the official rustup installer, which manages Rust versions and makes it possible to switch between stable, beta, and nightly toolchains. This setup is required before compiling the OS kernel for a custom target.
